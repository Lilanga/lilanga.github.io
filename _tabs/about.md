Hello there! Welcome to my blog.

I am an experianced software engineer, solutions architect, IoT engineer in professional life. I am a tinker, SDR lover, Cyclist, and one of the worse guitar player in my personal life.

This is my personal blog to share some of views and things I ~~steal~~ learn from different places. Although world is an illustion, Sometimes things are realtively true (I think so).

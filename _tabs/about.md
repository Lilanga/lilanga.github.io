 I'm Lilanga Gamage! 🚀

Welcome to my digital corner in the vast landscape of the internet. I'm a passionate software engineer residing in the vibrant and tech-savvy city of Sydney and its surrounding greater area. 🏙️💻

When I'm not crafting lines of code that bring innovative ideas to life, you'll often find me exploring outskirts of New South Wales on my bike, or tinkering with my IoT projects. 🚴🤖

>I am an experianced software engineer, solutions architect, IoT engineer in professional life.
>I am a tinker, SDR lover, Cyclist, and one of the worse guitar player in my personal life.
